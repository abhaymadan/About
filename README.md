# About
Hi there, I'm Abhay! ðŸ‘‹
I'm an undergraduate Computer Science Majors student , currently in my final year of graduation. You will find a variety of completed and semi-completed projects in my repositories. I have explored a small array of fields in computer science and continue to do so! Some of the work relates to my research and corporate internships.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java and practicing Data Structures and Algorithms.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with other developers.
ðŸ¥… 2020 Goals: Contribute more to open source projects.
âš¡ Fun fact: I wrote my first computer program when I was 17.
